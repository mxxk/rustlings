2. Copy this repo's files.
3. Run the repl! It will run `cargo test`.

## Nix and Replit

To run this repo on Replit, the repl you create must [support Nix](https://docs.replit.com/tutorials/30-build-with-nix), but since it's a new feature at the time of this writing, not all created repls seem to opt in to it.

1. To check whether an existing repl supports Nix, check whether Nix: is available in the repl shell:

    ```
    which nix
    ```
2. To create a new repl with Nix support, follow the forking instructions in [this guide](https://docs.replit.com/tutorials/30-build-with-nix).
